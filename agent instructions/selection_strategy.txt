AGENT SELECTION STRATEGY

1. Basic Flow:
   • Start (no messages) → WeatherAgent
   • After WeatherAgent → SnowResearchLead
   • After SnowResearchLead → ResearchAssistant
   • After ResearchAssistant → Blizzard

2. Question Handling:
   • If message contains "?" → Next relevant expert responds
   • WeatherAgent for weather questions
   • SnowResearchLead for analysis questions
   • ResearchAssistant for validation questions

3. Validation:
   • If analysis needs review → ResearchAssistant
   • After validation → Blizzard for final verdict

4. Selection Logic:
   IF (no messages OR only USER message)
   RETURN: WeatherAgent

   IF (last message from WeatherAgent)
   RETURN: SnowResearchLead

   IF (last message from SnowResearchLead)
   RETURN: ResearchAssistant

   IF (last message from ResearchAssistant)
   RETURN: Blizzard

   IF (last message contains "?")
   RETURN: Most relevant expert based on question topic
