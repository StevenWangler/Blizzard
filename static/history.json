            "prediction": "```\nSNOW DAY VERDICT: NO  \nCHANCE OF SNOW DAY: 30%  \n\nMY REASONING:  \nThe data and local preparedness strongly suggest that Rockford Public Schools can operate on a standard schedule. The heaviest snow and visibility reductions are concentrated overnight, with improvements expected before bus routes begin. Wind chills, although very cold, do not reach the district's threshold for closure, and experienced road crews will likely have major roads adequately cleared. Secondary road challenges may still exist but not to the extent that a district-wide closure is warranted.  \n\nKEY SUPPORTING FACTORS:  \n1. **Timing of Hazards**: Severe impacts, including snowfall and low visibility, improve by early morning, aligning favorably with school commute hours.  \n2. **Wind Chill Levels**: Remaining above the critical closure threshold of -20\u00b0F, projected levels around 6-7\u00b0F are manageable.  \n3. **Road Clearance Efficiency**: Adequate time overnight for snow crew operations ensures major commuting routes will likely be functional.  \n\nBRIEF EXPLANATION:  \nWhile the Winter Storm Warning indicates substantial snow and cold, the most severe conditions are not anticipated to coincide with morning travel periods. Barring major changes in snow intensity overnight, Rockford Public Schools' infrastructure and preparedness should ensure safe operations. Parents should prepare for cold conditions and monitor any early morning updates, but schools are expected to remain open.  \n```",

            "prediction": "```\nSNOW DAY VERDICT: YES  \nCHANCE OF SNOW DAY: 75%  \n\nMY REASONING:  \nBased on the Winter Storm Warning, Rockford will likely experience severe travel disruptions due to 3\u20139 inches of snow, 50 mph wind gusts, and visibility below 1/4 mile in blowing snow. These conditions coincide with morning transportation hours, heavily impairing bus-dependent routes and posing risks for students waiting in single-digit wind chills (6\u00b0F). Given this, it is prudent to declare a snow day to ensure student safety despite the district\u2019s high tolerance for winter weather.  \n\nKEY SUPPORTING FACTORS:  \n1. **Critical weather timing** overlapping morning commutes with severe snowfall and poor visibility.  \n2. **High wind gusts creating blowing snow and making rural roads less navigable.**  \n3. **Low wind chills** posing additional health hazards, especially for students at bus stops.  \n\nBRIEF EXPLANATION:  \nSevere winter conditions are expected to impact the Rockford area during school transport hours, creating an unsafe environment for buses and student travel. With limited visibility, strong winds, and health risks posed by wind chills, a snow day decision aligns best with the district's focus on safety. Overnight monitoring of conditions may refine this forecast, but current outlooks strongly support closure.  \n```",
