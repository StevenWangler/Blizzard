            "prediction": "```\nSNOW DAY VERDICT: YES  \nCHANCE OF SNOW DAY: 75%  \n\nMY REASONING:  \nBased on the Winter Storm Warning, Rockford will likely experience severe travel disruptions due to 3\u20139 inches of snow, 50 mph wind gusts, and visibility below 1/4 mile in blowing snow. These conditions coincide with morning transportation hours, heavily impairing bus-dependent routes and posing risks for students waiting in single-digit wind chills (6\u00b0F). Given this, it is prudent to declare a snow day to ensure student safety despite the district\u2019s high tolerance for winter weather.  \n\nKEY SUPPORTING FACTORS:  \n1. **Critical weather timing** overlapping morning commutes with severe snowfall and poor visibility.  \n2. **High wind gusts creating blowing snow and making rural roads less navigable.**  \n3. **Low wind chills** posing additional health hazards, especially for students at bus stops.  \n\nBRIEF EXPLANATION:  \nSevere winter conditions are expected to impact the Rockford area during school transport hours, creating an unsafe environment for buses and student travel. With limited visibility, strong winds, and health risks posed by wind chills, a snow day decision aligns best with the district's focus on safety. Overnight monitoring of conditions may refine this forecast, but current outlooks strongly support closure.  \n```",
